# 🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection using YOLOv5  
### Real-Time Driver Safety Monitoring System (Computer Vision Project)

This project demonstrates **driver drowsiness detection in real time** using the YOLOv5 object detection framework.  
It identifies fatigue-related behaviors such as **closed eyes**, **yawning**, and **driver distraction**.  

The implementation is done inside a **Jupyter Notebook** and is based on concepts learned from various online resources and tutorials.

## 🧩 Overview

This project analyzes the driver’s face in real time to detect:

- 👁️ **Closed Eyes** (sleepiness)  
- 😮 **Yawning**  
- 👀 **Looking Away / Distraction**  
- 🙂 **Normal Awake State**

It uses **YOLOv5**, a fast and accurate deep learning model for object detection.
